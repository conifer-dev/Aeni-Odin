# About
*A simple spritesheet animation system* based on [Aeni for Swift](https://github.com/conifer-dev/Aeni) Ported over to Odin!

Aeni allows you to quickly and easily animate your spritesheet in your Raylib for Odin project! It divides the process into two simple steps to create a working animation.

Aeni is a shortened word for *"aenimeisheon"* in Korean which translates to "Animation".

# Work-In-Progress! Please come back later!
